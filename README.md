This repository provides Chromium Web Browser Stable/Candidate/Beta/Edge releases built from the Snap packages to AppImages.

*NOTE: the 32-bit version for the old i386 architectures is available at [ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database), download it from [here](https://github.com/ivan-hc/32-bit-AppImage-packages-database/releases/tag/chromium).*

# Troubleshoot
AppImages based on Electron require the kernel to be configured in a certain way to allow for its sandboxing to work as intended (specifically, the kernel needs to be allowed to provide “unprivileged namespaces”). Many distributions come with this configured out of the box (like Ubuntu for instance), but some do not (for example Debian), and the AppImage works only with the `--no-sandbox` option.

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
